      	<p>This will serve as a little exercise to see how well all this stuff is clicking, in addition to getting you comfortable with some more advanced styling techniques. This is a screenshot of a site.

      		<h2>1. Some boxes in a row.</h2>
      		<p>Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.

      		<h2>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h2>
      		<p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like width: 100%;. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like font-family: monospace;.<br><br>

      	<div class="boxes">
      		<h2>3. This is a big link.</h2>
      		<p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.</p>
